Oh this? I just got this from the mutated bugs and corpses littered around my kingdom.

Though, yes. I do consume it. It makes a good ingredient in my great stews.

I AM the king after all! A king needs to live to the fullest! But don't expect a taste of my stews! IT'S MINE! Though cooking does take a while..

If you want to make good stews you have to wait for this.. shimmer you call it? You have to wait for it to ripen.. as well as find the right feces to mix it in and some of those crushed puffcaps..

Urgh.. That's... uh.. quite a stomach.. Don't worry about your stew. I don't think a belly like mine can take it. Heh... (Pukes)

Ah... You surface dwellers and your weak stomachs. Though if you want advice from the best! Just ask your humble king! Granted you give ME some of the food for tribute.
