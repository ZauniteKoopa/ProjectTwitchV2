What? No.. no.. Those are.. mutated. Your majesty, you're not the only one that mutated down here. They lost all sanity when they do. Poor things..

But they're certainly more of them since you came... You're not responsible for this, yes?

It's... a tough job being down here, Twitch. A pretty dang tough job if I do say so myself.

That didn't answer my question.. Just.. keep your stupid pets out of this, and we'll be fine.
