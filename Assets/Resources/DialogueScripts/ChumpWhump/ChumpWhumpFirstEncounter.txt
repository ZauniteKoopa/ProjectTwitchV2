I never understand you surface dwellers and your obsession with.. ugh.. shiny stuff. It's all worthless! You can't eat it.. and you can't turn it into potions.. What's the use!?

Arrr.. I dunno really? Maybe it's just that I like looking at me reflection? Tee hee.. Guess we surface dwellers got a load of the shinies or something. Humans love this stuff even more

They like it so much, that you can give it to them for exchange for other useful stuff. Like decent food.

Bah! But their food isn't even good! Ugh.. Just take it and give me actually useful stuff!
